# Codenames - Distributed Game Project

This repository contains the group project for our 5th semester of computer science studies. The goal of the project is to develop a distributed online version of the game Codenames, based on the popular board game "Tajniacy."

### Key features of the project:

* Multiplayer functionality: Teams of players will compete to guess hidden words based on clues given by the team captain.

* Secure connections: Ensuring that game sessions and player data are secure and protected.

### Technologies:

* Backend: Node.js, Express
* Database: MongoDB (for storing player stats and game results)
* Networking: WebSockets for real-time communication between players
* Version control: Git
